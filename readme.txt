Basic breakdown of the contents in this folder:

00-CPP IDEs
Some quick research that I did to find good IDEs for C++
Later, I also decided that this would be a good way to keep centrally located 
	documentation so that I don't have to run around finding the right tutorial.
The serial numbers at the beginning relate to the tutorial number and 
	lesson folder that I found them in

01-Derek
Single video tutorial by Derek Banas to give quick overview of C++

02-Bucky
Series of videos by Bucky Roberts to give a better understanding of C++

03-CPP Institute
A final training that is supposed to prepare you for the C++ 
	certification program that the C++ institute offers

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Plans for stretching my understanding:

11-API Google
Use Google APIs to do something simple 
	like find the distance between 2 locations

12-API stocks
use APIs to gather basic stock info, 
	I think I saw this done once with Yahoo Finance APIs
	I believe this involved joining multiple API calls 
		to get different sets of data

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Plans for super stretching my understanding, if I have time:

21-Multi threading
advance the stock API to include multiple stocks, say from the fortune 500 list, 
and make multiple calls to speed the process.

22-DLL function
find a way to create DLL functionality that will later be used to plug into MQL4

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Capstone Ideas, If I have time:

31-DB Call
use stock calls from above API to fill DB with recent data
This will be a bit harder because I will need to find a way to 
	hide/encrypt the DB login info
And I will have needed to have advanced far enough in my Linux training 
	to be able to setup a DB platform that I can link to

32-GPU Enhance
Modern C++ gives the ability to use the GPU to help process things, like big data, very quickly
I will have to figure out something that I can do that would leverage this well
It will likely relate to crunching numbers created with the DB call project above

33-UI Coding
If I can not come up with something for the GPU Enhance project
I can do basic UI coding from scratch to maybe create a simple game or something
